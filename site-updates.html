		Well, I created a website. I bought the domains ryanizant.space, rizant.space, and izant.space in mid-March because I wanted to jump on them as soon as I decided to make a website. RyanIzant.com was taken. Due to the semester, however, I didn't get around to figuring out hosting until today. For now I've decided to just used github pages hosting. I think this makes sense for me for now given that my website is very simple and <i> very </i> static. I'm following the html tutorial over at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank"> W3schools</a> and I have no idea what I'll do once I get through these.
	</p>

		The goal for this website is to make everything super raw and blazing fast. I'm not interested in intricate animations or dynamic content (yet?). If I ever don't meet that goal, let me know (which is a fun request because I haven't put up personal contact info yet).
