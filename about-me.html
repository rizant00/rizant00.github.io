	<h3> The Stats </h3>
		<p title="A Little About Me">
			I am a rising Senior at Brown Univeristy studying Electrical Engineering.
			<br/>
			I am the systems engineer/technical lead at Brown Space Engineering (BSE). We are building a 1U CubeSat named <a href="http://browncubesat.org" target="_blank"> EquiSat</a>.
			<br/>
			RyanIzant.com was taken, but its ok because I like space.
			<br/>
			This summer I will be interning at <a href="http://www.spacex.com" target="_blank"> SpaceX </a> in their Avionics Systems Integration team.

	<h3>"What's the deal with this guy anyway?"</h3>
		<p tite="I mean come on, really??">
			I like to build things. I generally lean towards hardware, though I have significant experience with software projects of various sorts(see - this website). Regardless, I want to build things that go to, or to the edge of (#firststage) space. [Note to self, I should make all of these side remarks that I keep putting in parentheses a mouse over effect sort of like xkcd or mezhdunami.]
